\section{Context} \label{context}
There are more case studies conducted in the past about the usefulness of Ampersand.
Like the graduation study of \citeNonPub{koopman_tim_adequate_2014} and the example study of \citeNonPub{baecke_elleke_argument_2018} about adapting Ampersand in legal environment.
Also in the field of legislation.
This case study aims to demonstrate that this is also possible for legislation coming from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.

For knowledge of Ampersand, the books by ~\citeNonPub{wedemeijer_lex_joosten_stef_woude_jaap_van_der_rule-based_nodate}
and \citeNonPub{wedemeijer_l_joosten_smm_michels_garkenbout_jlc_werkboek_ontwerpen_met_bedrijfsregelspdf_nodate} from the Open University are available.
