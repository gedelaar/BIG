  abstract = {Reactive programming has recently gained popularity as a paradigm that is well-suited for developing event-driven and interactive applications. It facilitates the development of such applications by providing abstractions to express time-varying values and automatically managing dependencies between such values. A number of approaches have been recently proposed embedded in various languages such as Haskell, Scheme, JavaScript, Java, .NET, etc. This survey describes and provides a taxonomy of existing reactive programming approaches along six axes: representation of time-varying values, evaluation model, lifting operations, multidirectionality, glitch avoidance, and support for distribution. From this taxonomy, we observe that there are still open challenges in the field of reactive programming. For instance, multidirectionality is supported only by a small number of languages, which do not automatically track dependencies between time-varying values. Similarly, glitch avoidance, which is subtle in reactive programs, cannot be ensured in distributed reactive programs using the current techniques.},

Key parts of the formalisation are presented in greater detail. An analysis of the work from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives substantiates that the design goals were met. In particular, the size ratio of formal to “pen and paper” text does not increase when going further into the book. The analysis also yields guidance on locales including patterns of use, which are identiﬁed and described.},

Industrial Marketing Management (IMM) has actively encouraged the use of case methods, resulting in many important theoretical advances in the field. However, debate still rages over what constitutes “good case research”. This article addresses this issue from a positivist standpoint. We examine the how authors address issues of quality in the 105 qualitative case studies published in IMM between 1971 and 2006. Four periods were identified: 1971–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–1999, and 2000–2006. Findings demonstrate that, from a positivist viewpoint, there has been a steady improvement in how authors addressed issues of research quality in published qualitative case studies. Suggestions for changes in data presentation, reviewer expectations, the IMM reviewer feedback form, and the use of web-based appendices containing data pertinent to reader judgments of research quality are suggested.},

  abstract = {Fran (Functional Reactive Animation) is a collection of data types and functions for composing richly interactive, multimedia animations. The key ideas in Fran are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are sets of arbitrarily complex conditions, carrying possibly rich information. Most traditional values can be treated as behaviors, and when images are thus treated, they become animations. Although these notions are captured as data types rather than a programming language, we provide them with a denotational semantics, including a proper treatment of real time, to guide reasoning and implementation. A method to effectively and efficiently perform event detection using interval analysis is also described, which relies on the partial information structure on the domain of event times. Fran has been implemented in Hugs, yielding surprisingly good performance for an interpreter-based system. Several examples are given, including the ability to describe physical phenomena involving gravity, springs, velocity, acceleration, etc. using ordinary differential equations.},

Is this, however, the only interpretation of triangulation and in what way is it consistent with case study research that is often concerned with naturalistic settings and nuanced interpretations? The purpose of this study is to delve into the role of triangulation in qualitative case study research in order to re-appraise its role. The study offers firstly, an inventory of triangulation categories for case study research in industrial marketing and secondly, a theoretical reframing of triangulation consisting of three modes - convergence, complementarity and divergence. Both the inventory and the reframing are discussed with reference to illustrations of published case studies, thus extending current understanding of research practice in industrial marketing.},

Based on intensional semantics, the tuple weights of the result of a PRA expression always conform to the underlying probabilistic model. We also show for which expressions extensional semantics yields the same results. Furthermore, we discuss complexity issues and indicate possibilities for optimization. With regard to databases, the approach allows for representing imprecise attribute values, whereas for information retrieval, probabilistic document indexing and probabilistic search term weighting can be modeled. We introduce the concept of vague predicates which  yield probabilistic weights instead of Boolean values, thus allowing for queries with vague selection conditions. With these features, PRA implements uncertainty and vagueness in combination with the relational model.},

  abstract = {Process-Design System (PDS) is a novel, rapid turn around, and rule-based process-cell design platform. It facilitates a gradual evolution of a design from an initial static concept to a functional monitoring system, and then to an operational transaction-driven process control system. PDS provides high productivity gains both in the cell-design process as well as in the operations of the implemented production cell. It’s capabilities extend to the design of the supporting organizational structure that leads to lean and productive manufacturing enterprise. The design and implementation of a transaction driven process controller facilitates also the creation of an audit trail for quality assurance standards as commonly adopted by industry, i.e. following ISO9000 protocol. PDS employs techniques of graphic programming to automatically generate an underlying database that deﬁnes the static structure of a process-cell. Furthermore, graphic link chains are employed to automatically generate a transaction ﬂow infrastructure, supporting the corresponding process monitors and controllers. The PDS design paradigm provides a turnaround of several human-days effort for the design of a static model of a small-scale process cell. It takes about one human-month effort to extend it to an operational, dynamic process-cell controller. It accommodates a mixed-process environment that supports partially automated and partially human-based processing. Incremental design capabilities lead to partial but functional implementations of local monitors and/or controllers. PDS focuses on the productivity of the individual designer in the context of extensive teamwork. r 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

But which are the features that make relation algebra practical? This paper discusses these features and motivates them from an information system designer's point of view. The resulting language, Ampersand, is a syntactically sugared version of relation algebra. It is a typed language, which is supported by a compiler. The design approach, also called Ampersand, uses software tools that compile Ampersand scripts into functional specifications. This makes Ampersand interesting as an application of relation algebra in the industrial practice. The purpose of this paper is to define Ampersand and motivate its features from a practical perspective.},

By combining multiple observers, theories, methods, and empirical materials, researchers hope to overcome the weakness or intrinsic biases and the problems that come from single method, single-observer, and single-theory studies.
               It is popularly used in sociology. "The concept of triangulation is borrowed from navigational and land surveying techniques that determine a single point in space with the convergence of measurements taken from two other distinct points."In particular:
               
               It can be used in both quantitative and qualitative studies.
               It is a method-appropriate strategy of founding the credibility of qualitative analyses.

This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors’ own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},

Being responsible for the implementation and execution of complex and ever changing regulations, for which the use of IT systems is a necessity, this organization has become aware of their dependence on trustworthy methods to assure the correct implementation of law into their operations and services. While many attempts to automate law, even in the domain of migration law, have been made before, hardly any attention has been paid to the ‘translation process’ from legal rules expressed in natural language to specifications in computer executable form. In this paper, we will explain the method we have developed and illustrate its application with some concrete examples.

  abstract = {Not all queries in relational calculus can be answered sensibly when  disjunction, negation, and universal quantification are allowed. The class of relation calculus queries or formulas that have sensible answers is called the
              domain independent
              class which is known to be undecidable. Subsequent research has focused on identifying large decidable subclasses of domain independent formulas. In this paper we investigate the properties of two such classes: the
              evaluable
              formulas and the
              allowed
              formulas. Although both classes have been defined before, we give simplified definitions, present short proofs of their main properties, and describe a method to incorporate equality.
              
              
              Although evaluable queries have sensible answers,   it is not straightforward to compute them efficiently or correctly. We introduce
              relational algebra normal form
              for formulas from which form the correct translation into relational algebra is trivial. We give algorithms to transform an evaluable formula into an equivalent
              allowed
              formula and from there into relational algebra normal form. Our algorithms avoid use of the so-called
              Dom
              relation, consisting of all constants appearing in the database or the query.
              
              Finally, we describe a restriction under which every domain independent formula is evaluable and argue that the class of evaluable formulas is the largest decidable subclass of the domain independent formulas that can be efficiently recognized.},

  abstract = {Background:
              Case studies are regularly published in the software engineering literature, and guidelines for conducting case studies are available. Based on a perception that the label “case study” is assigned to studies that are not case studies, an investigation has been conducted.
              Objective:
              The aim was to investigate whether or not the label “case study” is correctly used in software engineering research.
              Method:
              To address the objective, 100 recent articles found through Scopus when searching for case studies in software engineering have been investigated and classified.
              Results:
              Unfortunately, the perception of misuse of the label “case study” is correct. Close to 50\% of the articles investigated were judged as not being case studies according to the definition of a case study.
              Conclusions:
              We either need to ensure correct use of the label “case study”, or we need another label for its definition. Given that “case study” is a well-established label, it is probably impossible to change the label. Thus, we introduce an alternative definition of case study emphasising its real-life context, and urge researchers to carefully follow the definition of different research methods when presenting their research.},
