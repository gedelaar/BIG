During the graduation project, research was conducted into the suitability of Ampersand for designing registers for the government.
These registers are always based on legislation and regulations.
The research focuses on a specific law, namely the \acrshort{big}.
\newline
This law does not stand alone.
The associated laws and regulations are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Wet op de beroepen in de individuele gezondheidszorg
    \item Besluit periodieke registratie Wet BIG
    \item Registratiebesluit BIG
    \item Tuchtrechtbesluit BIG
    \item Regeling periodieke registratie Wet BIG
    \item Regeling tarieven registratie beroepsbeoefenaren Wet BIG
    \item Algemene wet erkenning EU-beroepskwalificaties
\end{enumerate} 
In principle, these laws and regulations are part of an investigation into the suitability of Ampersand.
However, the time that can be spent on the research does not allow to include all parts.
After all, the aim is not to provide a fully elaborated conceptual analysis.
By applying the principle of time-boxing, only a limited part of the legislation and regulations is analyzed and converted to Ampersand scripts.
