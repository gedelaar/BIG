\subsection{Registry systems} \label{Registry systems}
\def\cat{4}
There are few observations about registration systems.
In the interviews, some comments were made about information systems, but that is often not very specific registration systems.

Registration systems are aligned with \acrshort{rk} at the \acrshort{cibg}.
The approach advocated by Ampersand is conceptually in line with \acrshort{rk} (\iref{int:I-2.10}).
The terminology used by \acrshort{rk} differs in many areas from what the \acrshort{big} prescribes.
This is not an Ampersand issue, but means that a mapping of terms must take place after the analysis (\iref{int:I-2.6}, \iref{int:I-2.7}).
A number of functions that we model in Ampersand also appear as generic functions in \acrshort{rk} (\iref{int:I-2.9}).
Since Ampersand is a reactive system, process support is controlled from \acrshort{rk} (\iref{int:I-2.9}).

}

Across registers, independent of \acrshort{rk}, there are common values between the laws.
Here also the generic elements must be marked, so that reuse can take place (\oref{obs:rq1-85:30-11}).
When reusing and separating elements, the multicontext problem is encountered (\oref{obs:rq1-92:14-12}).
The format of a register is subjective (\oref{obs:rq3-8:19-9}, \oref{obs:rq3-9:19-9}).
