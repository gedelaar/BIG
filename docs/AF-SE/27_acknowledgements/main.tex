\section{Acknowledgements} \label{acknowledgements}

This thesis was made possible with the help of many people.
First of all I would like to thank Stef Joosten and the Ampersand team.
Stef guided me through this phase.
I found in another thesis in which Stef was described as a fantastic supervisor, knowledgeable , supportive, enthusiastic, and very approachable.
I wholeheartedly agree with this.
When I didn't know what to do anymore, he knows how to motivate me and shows me the way to continue.
I also wish other students such a pleasant and knowledgeable supervisor.

I would also like to thank Jasper Kuijten for guidance from \acrshort{cibg} and for pointing out the research direction and the regular discussions about this.
With Stef and Jasper I got through the research period and here is the product.

Of course I would like to thank all the people who were bothered by the fact that I needed so much time for my studies.
I took time off from work very regularly and part of my task fell on the shoulders of colleagues.

I certainly could not have done this without the support of my own family.
My wife, Fieke, who always gave me space and encouraged me to continue.
Sophie, Philip and Sarah who also always had to listen to me about the study and research.
Thank you for reading the thesis.
I really appreciate the space and mental support that has been given.
